## m.apper ##

The purpose of this site is to provide an enhanced map for Meetup.com users
in order that they can find events within a geographical range.

Users can further refine events by category, distance, timeframe, and whether
they are free/ticketed.

Users can RSVP to events via Meetup OAuth, and can also save events to their
profile on m.apper in order to return to them later if they can't decide
whether to RSVP immediately.

This site is built using Node.js, Express, and Handlebars.
